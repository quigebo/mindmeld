MindMeld Style Guide (v1)

1. Brand Personality
	•	Adjectives: Warm · Modern · Intimate · Trustworthy · Fun
	•	Essence: Personal connections at the center, with AI as a subtle, helpful background element.
	•	Voice:
	•	Casual, warm, inviting.
	•	Sprinkles of joy and enthusiasm without being over the top.
	•	Conversational tone, as if a close friend is encouraging you to share a memory.
	•	Avoid jargon; keep words simple and human.

Example:

“Hey, remember that trip we took? Let’s bring it back to life.”
“A couple more details and we can weave this into something special.”

2. Visual Language

Photography & Illustration
	•	Use rich, illustrated visuals showing people interacting (laughing, sharing, talking).
	•	Incorporate abstract shapes—sound waves, puzzle pieces, threads—to suggest merging perspectives.
	•	Keep backgrounds minimal so people/illustrations are the focus.
	•	Photo use is occasional but should be warm-toned, with subtle film grain when included.

3. Interaction & Motion

Transitions
	•	Playful but gentle (ease-in-out 300–400ms).
	•	Card slides, modal fades, and subtle bounce when new memories load.
	•	Physical Gesture Mimicry:
	•	Swipe interactions feel like flipping through photos or cards.
	•	Pull-to-refresh feels like stretching a thread before it snaps back.

Micro-Interactions
	•	Common iOS patterns (tappable cards, haptic feedback for recording start/stop, swipe to reply).
	•	Reaction emojis animate slightly (bounce or grow briefly).

Synthesis Moment Animation
	•	Sound waves from different directions merge into one fluid waveform.
	•	Waveform “settles” into a still form, symbolizing the completed story.

4. Technical Notes
	•	Platform: Hotwire Native (web views inside native container).
	•	Follow Apple HIG spacing, touch targets (44px min), and safe areas.
	•	Avoid photo-heavy layouts—design should feel balanced with text and illustration.
	•	Light/dark modes maintain the same emotional tone with adjusted contrast.
